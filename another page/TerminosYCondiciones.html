    <h2 id="accounts-and-membership">Accounts and membership</h2>
    <p>
      If you create an account on the Website, you are responsible for
      maintaining the security of your account and you are fully responsible for
      all activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in
      connection with it. We may, but have no obligation to, monitor and review
      new accounts before you may sign in and start using the Services.
      Providing false contact information of any kind may result in the
      termination of your account. You must immediately notify us of any
      unauthorized uses of your account or any other breaches of security. We
      will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages
      of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions. We may
      suspend, disable, or delete your account (or any part thereof) if we
      determine that you have violated any provision of this Agreement or that
      your conduct or content would tend to damage our reputation and goodwill.
      If we delete your account for the foregoing reasons, you may not
      re-register for our Services. We may block your email address and Internet
      protocol address to prevent further registration.

      Services to you. Without limiting any of those representations or
      warranties, we have the right, though not the obligation, to, in our own
      sole discretion, refuse or remove any Content that, in our reasonable
      opinion, violates any of our policies or is in any way harmful or
      objectionable. You also grant us the license to use, reproduce, adapt,
